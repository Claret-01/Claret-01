# üåπ Hello Stranger, I'm Claret  

I‚Äôm not here to drop a boring
‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm passionate about tech‚Ä¶‚Äù intro.  

From HTML & CSS days to actually pushing JavaScript ES6, React + Vite, and currently learning Solidity + Foundry.

Right now, I‚Äôm focused on Front-end building with **React, TypeScript, Node.js**, and exploring the Web3 world because we're going into a decentralized world, and I want to be part of the builders shaping it.

If you see me around here, expect projects, experiments, and maybe some chaos, but always growth. üå±
